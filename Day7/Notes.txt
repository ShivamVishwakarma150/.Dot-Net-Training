Constructors
------------

• Constructors are special methods of the class, which initializes the Fields and perform any initialization process, which will be called automatically when an object is created for the class.

• Constructors are used to receive a set of parameters and initialize those parameters into respective Fields.

• For example, you have a class with Fields. So your constructor can receive 3 arguments and assign those arguments into Fields respectively. 
However, if you don’t want to initialize all the Fields, you can receive less no. of arguments also. For example, you can initialize 1 or 2 Fields also.

• When an object is created, the following process happens internally:
o Memory will be allocated for the object in RAM (in Heap of RAM).
o Default values will be initialized (based on the data type).
o Constructor will be called automatically.

Syntax of Constructor
---------------------

public Classname(datatype variable1, datatype variable2, …)
{
Field1 = variable1;
Field2 = variable2;
…
}

Types of Constructor
---------------------
• Parameter-less constructor: A constructor that has no arguments. It initializes Fields with some fixed values.

class Sample
{
    //Fields
    public int a, b;

    //constructor
    public Sample()
    {
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
    }
}

• Parameterized constructor: A constructor that has one or more arguments. It initializes Fields with argument (varied) values.

class Sample
{
    //Fields
    public int a, b;

    //constructor
    public Sample(int x, int y)
    {
        a = x;
        b = y;
    }
}

Default Constructor
--------------------
• As per the rules of c#.net, a class should have a constructor. If you don’t create a constructor in the class, .net creates an empty constructor (implicit constructor or default constructor) automatically and internally.




"Set" and "Get" Methods
-------------------------

• “Set methods” and “get methods” are used to perform “validation” on a private Field.

• You must create the Field as “private Field”, for security.

Set Method
----------

• Set method receives a value as argument, checks (validates) it, and then assigns the same into the Field.

• Set method protects the Field from invalid values.

• Set method acts as mediator between Main method and Field.

• Set method is used to perform validations and makes the program stronger and systematic.

• Note: When set method is created, it is recommended to make the Field as “private”. 
        The private members are accessible only within the same class.

• Syntax of Set Method:

public void SetFieldName(Datatype Argument)
{
Field = Argument;
}

Get Method
-----------
• Get method returns the value of a Field.

• Get method can perform automatic calculations.

• Syntax of Get Method:

public Returntype GetFieldName( )
{
return (Field);
}



Properties
----------

• A property is a group of “set method” and “get method”, which perform validation on a private Field.

• Properties are used to implement a protection layer around Field.

• Properties can't store any value.

• Properties are used for validations and automatic calculations. The “set method” is used to create validations;
 and “get method” is used to create automatic calculations or return the value of a Field as it is.

• Properties offer simple way to call “set method” and “get method”.

• In real time, for every private Field, we create a property. That means the private Field is not accessible directly in the client code; though property it can be accessible indirectly.

• The property’s set method will be called automatically when a value is assigned to a property.

• The property’s set method has an implicit argument called “value” that represents the value assigned to the property.

• The property’s get method will be called automatically when the client code gets the value of the property.

• The property’s get method has no arguments but should return the value.

• Note: While creating properties, it is recommended to create Field name start with “_” (underscore). The underscore has no meaning, but it indicates that it is Field.
 

Syntax to create a property:
-----------------------------

public Datatype Propertyname
{
    set
    {
        Field = value;
    }
    get
    {
        return (Field);
    }
}

Properties Example 
------------------
//create a class called "Person"
class Person
{
    //private Field
    private int _age;

    //property (set + get)
    public int Age
    {
        set
        {
            if(value >= 18 && value <= 60)
            {
                _age = value;
            }
    }
        get
        {
            return _age;
        }
    }
}


Principles of Object Oriented Programming
==========================================

Principles of OOP
----------------

• OOP following the following principles.
    1) Encapsulation
    2) Inheritance
    3) Abstraction
    4) Polymorphism


1) Encapsulation:
    • Encapsulation is a concept of combining Fields and methods as a single unit called “object”.
    • This is implemented by creating classes with Fields and methods.
    • Fields are variables that stores the data; Methods are functions that manipulates the data.

2) Inheritance:
    • Inheritance is a concept of creating “parent-child” relationship among two or more classes.
    • As a result of inheritance, all the members of parent class are accessible in child class.

3) Abstraction:
    • Abstraction is a concept of hiding implementation details (internal logic) and providing only necessary details to other classes.
    • This is implemented by creating private Fields and public methods.

4) Polymorphism:
    • Polymorphism means "decision making".
    • Polymorphism means “the ability of a statement that calls different methods at different situations”.
