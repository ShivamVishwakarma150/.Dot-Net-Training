-- for Eg
-- Time taken for compilation
-- 20s + time taken for fetch / execute (20s) == 40s
-- Real time application
-- 10 tables, 15 cols, group by, where, having, subqueries
--  1 min + 1 min ==> 2 min
-- 2*4 => 8 mins

-- solution for saving the time we have to use stored procedure
-- stored procedure
-- it contain pre compiled statements
-- it is compiled once and can execute multiple times
-- Eg
